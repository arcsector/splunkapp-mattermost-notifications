# Splunk app Mattermost Notifications

This Splunk app creates a new alert trigger that allow users to send notification into a Mattermost Room by specifying an integration URL.
Notification message can be customized using Splunk tokens.

This app is based on HipChat Room Notification Alert app, created by Siegfried Puchbauer.
As Hipchat has been ended, some people have turned to Mattermost. This app should replace the Hipchat one.
